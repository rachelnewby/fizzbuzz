# FizzBuzz: Pair Programming

As part of the Makers Academy Bootcamp, this repo is the result of our first pair programming session. <br>
The task was to build the FizzBuzz program: <b>
Build a program which counts numbers: 
* If a number is divisible by 3, the student says “fizz” rather than the number.
* If a number is divisible by 5, they say “buzz” rather than the number.
* If a number is divisible by both, they say “fizz buzz”

This was achieved by following the TDD process in pairs, we switched pairs every 30 minutes and practiced driving and navigating. 

Paired with Alex Bodian.
